# OSF — Backlog

Open ideas, future considerations, and items intentionally deferred.
Separate from DECISIONS.md, which records decisions that have been
made. An entry in this backlog is **not** a commitment; it is a
note that the item has been considered and parked for later
discussion.

Organised by category. New entries should land in the most fitting
section (or open a new section if none fits).

## Spec Extensions / Future Format Revisions

### OSF6 (or future spec revision): null-terminator handling for string/binary

The trailing `0x00` byte on `string` and `binary` payloads in
`bcAbsTimeStampData` (mandatory in OSF4 and OSF5 per spec rev
2026-05-04) is a historical artefact from C-style string handling.
For binary payloads in particular it is an awkward fit: a JPEG file
ending in `0xD9 0xFF` becomes `0xD9 0xFF 0x00` on disk, and readers
that fail to strip the trailing byte produce invalid JPEGs.

Making the null-terminator optional in OSF5 was considered and
rejected: without a flag bit in the control byte, readers cannot
distinguish a deliberately-trailing `0x00` (e.g. inside an ASN.1
binary payload) from a spec-mandated terminator. Such a flag bit
would be a true spec change requiring all implementations to be
revised, with marginal payload savings (one byte per string or
binary sample).

A future spec revision (OSF6 or similar) could remove the trailing
byte entirely, with a clear version-bump signalling the format
change. Until then, the byte stays in both OSF4 and OSF5.

## Documentation Strategy

### Multi-language documentation system (after Java implementation)

Documentation strategy for the project as a whole is pending a
dedicated design session, scheduled to follow the Java
implementation reaching feature parity with C++ and Python. Topics
to be decided:

- Tooling per language (native Doxygen / rustdoc / Pydoc / PasDoc
  vs. unifying through Sphinx with breathe / sphinx-rustdocgen /
  autodoc).
- Multi-natural-language strategy (German and English minimum; how
  to keep them in sync — gettext workflow vs. parallel Markdown
  sources, manual translation vs. machine-assisted).
- Hosting (GitHub Pages, ReadTheDocs, dedicated domain).
- Example-code structure: examples kept in the repo, tested in CI,
  embedded in docs via `literalinclude` or equivalent so they cannot
  drift out of sync.
- Adoption focus: docs aimed at external readers who want to
  integrate OSF into their own projects or analyse OSF files
  produced by others — not primarily at internal contributors.

The strategic goal: make OSF easy enough to adopt that engineers
choose it over CSV or Parquet as the carrier format for measurement
data. Documentation is a first-class product, not an afterthought.

## Implementation Gaps and Conventions

### Java: GraalVM Native Image support

The Java implementation (DECISIONS §21) targets standard OpenJDK as
its baseline platform. GraalVM Native Image compilation is a plausible
future use case — particularly for edge gateways and container-native
deployments where startup time and footprint matter — but is not part
of the initial scope.

The two technical obstacles are well understood. First, Jackson uses
reflection internally for binding JSON to Java objects, which Native
Image requires explicit configuration for via `reflect-config.json`.
Second, our own `module-info.java` and any reflective patterns in the
public API would need a `reachability-metadata.json` audit.

A lightweight approach was considered: keep the implementation
"reflection-aware" from day one (i.e. avoid unnecessary reflection in
our own code, and prefer the Jackson `ObjectReader` API over the
annotation-driven mapper for the metablock parser). This adds no cost
today and would shrink the Native Image effort later from "rewrite
the JSON path" to "generate config files". This soft guideline is
followed during implementation; the actual Native Image work is
tracked here.

Triggers for action: a customer or internal project requests
deployment of the Java OSF library as a native binary, or a benchmark
shows the JVM startup cost is the bottleneck for a CLI-style use case
(e.g. an OSF-to-CSV converter in a CI pipeline).

### Java: embedded micro-JVM support

DECISIONS §21 explicitly targets full OpenJDK as the Java baseline,
based on the project owner's confirmation that the current embedded
recording use case runs on an industrial gateway with a complete JVM.
Two other Java-embedded scenarios were named but parked:

- Embedded micro-JVMs (Azul Zulu Embedded, Eclipse OpenJ9 in stripped
  configurations). These have reduced standard libraries and may
  exclude or restrict Jackson and other reflection-heavy libraries.
- Industrial microcontrollers running Java in AOT-compiled form.

The likely action if either becomes relevant: provide a Jackson-free
JSON parser path for OSF5 metablocks. The metablock JSON is small
and structurally regular — a hand-rolled streaming parser of a few
hundred lines is feasible and would remove the dependency on
reflection-heavy libraries entirely. The XML path (StAX, JDK-built-in)
is already micro-JVM-friendly. SLF4J also has minimal-footprint
variants for restricted JVMs.

Triggers for action: a concrete project requires deploying the OSF
library on a micro-JVM. Until then, no work needed.

### Java: memory-mapped files and direct buffers for high-throughput I/O

DECISIONS §21 chose `ByteBuffer` on `FileChannel` with heap-allocated
buffers and little-endian byte order as the I/O strategy. This is
sufficient for typical OSF workloads — SSD-bound throughput in the
500 MB/s to 1 GB/s range, which exceeds what current measurement
scenarios produce.

Two further optimisations were considered and deferred:

- **Direct buffers** (`ByteBuffer.allocateDirect`): live outside the
  Java heap, reducing copy steps between kernel and JVM. Useful when
  heap pressure from I/O buffers becomes a problem (large
  long-running services with many concurrent readers).
- **Memory-mapped files** (`FileChannel.map`): the OS maps the file
  into the process address space and lazily pages it in. Can deliver
  another 30–50% throughput improvement on sequential reads of
  multi-GB files. Has platform-specific gotchas, particularly on
  Windows (file locks held until the mapping is cleaned up, which
  requires careful use of the `Cleaner` API).

Neither is justified by current measurement workloads. They are
plausible if the Java implementation becomes the I/O layer for a
high-throughput Spark or Flink connector working on multi-GB files
and the standard ByteBuffer path measurably bottlenecks. Until
benchmarks on a real workload show the issue, the added complexity
(particularly the Windows file-lock semantics of memory-mapped files)
is not worth carrying.

Triggers for action: profiling on a representative workload shows
the I/O path is the bottleneck; or a connector implementation
explicitly needs random access into multi-GB OSF files.

### Delphi-Writer multi-sample string/binary uses non-spec layout

The Delphi writer's `WriteTimestampedBlock` for `string` and `binary`
channels can emit multi-sample blocks with a per-sample `uint32`
length prefix between samples
(`implementations/delphi/src/OSF.Filer.pas:593-602`). This layout is
not part of the spec and not understood by the Rust or C++ readers,
which expect either equal-length segments or one sample per block.

In practice, Delphi writers nearly always emit one sample per block
for variable-length types, so the incompatibility is latent. But a
Delphi-produced file that genuinely contains multi-sample string or
binary blocks would parse incorrectly on Rust and C++ readers.

Future action: align the Delphi writer with the Rust/C++ convention
(one sample per block for `string` and `binary`). The Delphi fix is
planned as part of a broader Delphi-implementation maintenance pass
that follows the OSF4/OSF5 spec update.

## How to add an entry

- Place under the most fitting section, or add a new section if
  needed.
- Each entry: a short `###` title summarising the topic, then a
  paragraph or two of context.
- State explicitly what was considered, what was decided (parked
  vs. ready to act), and what would unlock further action.
- Cross-link to relevant `DECISIONS.md` sections or
  `implementations/*/CHANGELOG.md` entries where applicable.
- Backlog entries are not commitments. They can be removed when a
  decision is taken (with the decision moving to `DECISIONS.md`)
  or when the item becomes irrelevant.
